Local modifications:
- Rewrite Android.mk to remove duplicate definitions and set module name
  in a consistent way with other external libraries
- Copy public headers from src/webp to include/webp, so path to headers
  may be appended into CFLAGS without risk for other private headers
  (e.g. bits.h) to leak into
- Removed build files necessary for building via autoconf/automake tools
  These files are not required to build via Android.mk
- Undefine WEBP_ANDROID_NEON on Android targets and use __ARM_NEON__
  instead.

The Android.mk file creates WebP decoder and encoder static libraries which
can be added to any application by adding to LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES
libwebp-decode libwebp-encode:

  LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += libwebp-decode libwebp-encode
