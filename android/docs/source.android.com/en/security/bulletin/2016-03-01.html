<p><em>Published March 07, 2016 | Updated March 08, 2016</em></p>

<p>We have released a security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air
(OTA) update as part of our Android Security Bulletin Monthly Release process.
The Nexus firmware images have also been released to the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">Google Developer site</a>.
Builds LMY49H or later and Android M with Security Patch Level of March 01, 2016 or later
address these issues. Refer to the
<a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705">Nexus documentation</a>
for instructions on how to check the security patch level.</p>

<p>Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on February
1, 2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have been
released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.</p>

<p>The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
<a href="/security/overview/updates-resources.html#severity">severity
assessment</a> is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.</p>

<p>We have had no reports of active customer exploitation of these newly reported
issues. Refer to the <a href="#mitigations">Mitigations</a> section for details on the
<a href="/security/enhancements/index.html">Android security platform protections</a>
and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the
Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their
devices.</p>

<h3 id=mitigations>Mitigations</h3>


<p>This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
<a href="/security/enhancements/index.html">Android security platform</a>
and service protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
the latest version of Android where possible.
  <li> The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
SafetyNet which will warn about potentially harmful applications about to be
installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play. To protect
users who install applications from outside of Google Play, Verify Apps is
enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting applications. Verify
Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known malicious
applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If such an
application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the user and
attempt to remove any such applications.
  <li> As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
pass media to processes such as mediaserver.
</ul>

<h2 id=security_vulnerability_details>Security Vulnerability Details</h2>


<p>In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2016-03-01 patch level.
There is a description of the issue, a severity rationale, and a table
with the CVE, associated bug, severity, affected versions, and date reported.
When available, we will link the AOSP change that addressed the issue to the
bug ID. When multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional AOSP
references are linked to numbers following the bug ID.</p>

<h3 id=remote_code_execution_vulnerability_in_mediaserver>Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Mediaserver</h3>


<p>During media file and data processing of a specially crafted file,
vulnerabilities in mediaserver could allow an attacker to cause memory
corruption and remote code execution as the mediaserver process.</p>

<p>The affected functionality is provided as a core part of the operating system,
and there are multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote
content, most notably MMS and browser playback of media.</p>

<p>This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of remote
code execution within the context of the mediaserver service. The mediaserver
service has access to audio and video streams as well as access to privileges
that third-party apps could not normally access.</p>

<h3 id=elevation_of_privilege_vulnerability_in_kernel_keyring_component>Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability in Kernel Keyring Component</h3>


<p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Kernel Keyring Component could
enable a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the
kernel. This issue is rated as a Critical severity due to the possibility of a
local permanent device compromise and the device could potentially only be
repaired by re-flashing the operating system. However, in Android versions 5.0
and above, SELinux rules prevents third-party applications from reaching the
affected code.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For reference, the patch in AOSP is available for specific kernel versions:
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/8a8431507f8f5910db5ac85b72dbdc4ed8f6b308">4.1</a>,

security measures in place to increase the difficulty of attackers exploiting
the platform. This issue is rated as High severity because it could permit a
bypass of security measures in place to increase the difficulty of attackers
exploiting the platform.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The update for this issue is
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8a5e5e02fc83aaf67053ab53b359af08c6c49aaf">located in the Linux upstream</a>.</p>

<h3 id=elevation_of_privilege_in_mediatek_connectivity_kernel_driver>Elevation of Privilege in MediaTek Connectivity Kernel Driver</h3>


<p>There is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a MediaTek connectivity
kernel driver that could enable a local malicious application to execute
arbitrary code within the context of the kernel. Normally a kernel code execution
bug like this would be rated critical, but because it requires first compromising
the conn_launcher service, it justifies a downgrade to High severity rating.

<h3 id=remote_denial_of_service_vulnerability_in_bluetooth>Remote Denial of Service Vulnerability in Bluetooth</h3>


<p>A remote denial of service vulnerability in the Bluetooth component could allow
a proximal attacker to block access to an affected device. An attacker could
cause an overflow of identified Bluetooth devices in the Bluetooth component,
which leads to memory corruption and service stop. This is rated as a High
severity because it leads to a Denial of Service to the Bluetooth service, which
could potentially only be fixed with a flash of the device.</p>
