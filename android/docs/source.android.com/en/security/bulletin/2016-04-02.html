<p><em>Published April 04, 2016 | Updated December 19, 2016</em></p>

<p>We have released a security update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air
(OTA) update as part of our Android Security Bulletin Monthly Release process.
The Nexus firmware images have also been released to the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images">Google Developer site</a>.
Security Patch Levels of April
02, 2016 or later address these issues (refer to the
<a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705">Nexus documentation</a>
for instructions on how to check the security patch level).</p>

<p>Partners were notified about the issues described in the bulletin on March 16,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have been
released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository.</p>

<p>The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods
such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
<a href="/security/overview/updates-resources.html#severity">severity
assessment</a> is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.</p>

<p><a href="/security/advisory/2016-03-18.html">
Android Security Advisory 2016-03-18</a> previously discussed use of
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1805">CVE-2015-1805</a>
by a rooting application. <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1805">CVE-2015-1805</a>
is resolved in this update.
There have been no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of the other
newly reported issues. Refer to the <a href="#mitigations">Mitigations</a> section
for further details on the <a href="/security/enhancements/index.html">
Android security platform protections</a> and service protections such as SafetyNet,
which improve the security of the Android platform.</p>

<h2 id=mitigations>Mitigations</h2>


<p>This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
<a href="/security/enhancements/index.html">Android security platform</a> and service
protections such as SafetyNet. These capabilities reduce the
likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on
Android.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by enhancements
in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users to update to
the latest version of Android where possible.
  <li> The Android Security team is actively monitoring for abuse with Verify Apps and
SafetyNet, which will warn the user about detected potentially harmful
applications about to be installed. Device rooting tools are prohibited within
Google Play. To protect users who install applications from outside of Google
Play, Verify Apps is enabled by default and will warn users about known rooting
applications. Verify Apps attempts to identify and block installation of known
malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability. If
such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps will notify the
user and attempt to remove any such applications.
  <li> As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not automatically
pass media to processes such as mediaserver.
</ul>

<h2 id=security_vulnerability_details>Security Vulnerability Details</h2>


<p>The sections below contain details for each of the security vulnerabilities
that apply to the 2016-04-02 patch level.
There is a description of the issue, a severity rationale, and a table
with the CVE, associated bug, severity, affected versions, and date reported.
When available, we will link the AOSP commit that addressed the issue to the
bug ID. When multiple changes relate to a single bug, additional AOSP references
are linked to numbers following the bug ID.</p>

<h3 id=remote_code_execution_vulnerability_in_dhcpcd>Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in DHCPCD</h3>


<p>A vulnerability in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol service could enable
an attacker to cause memory corruption, which could lead to remote code
execution. This issue is rated as Critical severity due to the possibility of
remote code execution within the context of the DHCP client. The DHCP service
has access to privileges that third-party apps could not normally access.</p>

<h3 id=remote_code_execution_vulnerability_in_media_codec>Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Media Codec</h3>


<p>During media file and data processing of a specially crafted file,
vulnerabilities in a media codec used by mediaserver could allow an attacker to
cause memory corruption and remote code execution as the mediaserver process.</p>

<p>The affected functionality is provided as a core part of the operating system,
and there are multiple applications that allow it to be reached with remote
content, most notably MMS and browser playback of media.</p>

<p>This issue is rated as Critical severity due to the possibility of remote code
execution within the context of the mediaserver service. The mediaserver
service has access to audio and video streams, as well as access to privileges
that third-party apps could not normally access.</p>
