<p>Every Android release includes dozens of security enhancements to protect
users. Here are some of the major security enhancements available in Android
6.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Runtime Permissions</strong>. Applications request permissions at
    runtime instead of being granted at App
    install time. Users can toggle permissions on and off for both M and pre-M
    applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Verified Boot</strong>. A set of cryptographic checks of system
    software are conducted prior to
    execution to ensure the phone is healthy from the bootloader all the way up to
    the operating system.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware-Isolated Security</strong>. New Hardware Abstraction
    Layer (HAL) used by Fingerprint API, Lockscreen,
    Device Encryption, and Client Certificates to protect keys against kernel
    compromise and/or local physical attacks</li>
  <li><strong>Fingerprints</strong>. Devices can now be unlocked with just a
    touch. Developers can also take
    advantage of new APIs to use fingerprints to lock and unlock encryption keys.</li>
  <li><strong>SD Card Adoption</strong>. Removable media can be
    <em>adopted</em> to a device and expand available storage for
    app local data, photos, videos, etc., but still be protected by block-level
    encryption.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear Text Traffic</strong>. Developers can use a new StrictMode
    to make sure their application doesn't use
    cleartext.</li>
  <li><strong>System Hardening</strong>. Hardening of the system via policies
    enforced by SELinux. This offers better
    isolation between users, IOCTL filtering, reduce threat of exposed services,
    further tightening of SELinux domains, and extremely limited /proc access.</li>
  <li><strong>USB Access Control:</strong> Users must confirm to allow USB
    access to files, storage, or other
    functionality on the phone. Default is now <em>charge only</em> with access
    to storage requiring explicit approval from the user.</li>
</ul>
