<p>
Every Android release includes dozens of security enhancements to protect
users. The following are some of the security enhancements available
in Android 4.4:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Android sandbox reinforced with SELinux.</strong>
  Android now uses SELinux in enforcing mode. SELinux is a mandatory
  access control (MAC) system in the Linux kernel used to augment the
  existing discretionary access control (DAC) based security model.
  This provides additional protection against potential security
  vulnerabilities.</li>

  <li><strong>Per User VPN.</strong>
  On multi-user devices, VPNs are now applied per user.
  This can allow a user to route all network traffic through a VPN
  without affecting other users on the device.</li>

  <li><strong>ECDSA Provider support in AndroidKeyStore.</strong>
  Android now has a keystore provider that allows use of ECDSA and
  DSA algorithms.</li>

  <li><strong>Device Monitoring Warnings.</strong>
  Android provides users with a warning if any certificate has been
  added to the device certificate store that could allow monitoring of
  encrypted network traffic.</li>

  <li><strong>FORTIFY_SOURCE.</strong>
  Android now supports FORTIFY_SOURCE level 2, and all code is compiled
  with these protections. FORTIFY_SOURCE has been enhanced to work with
  clang.</li>

  <li><strong>Certificate Pinning.</strong>
  Android 4.4 detects and prevents the use of fraudulent Google
  certificates used in secure SSL/TLS communications.</li>

  <li><strong>Security Fixes.</strong>
  Android 4.4 also includes fixes for Android-specific vulnerabilities.
  Information about these vulnerabilities has been provided to Open
  Handset Alliance members and fixes are available in Android Open Source
  Project. To improve security, some devices with earlier versions of
  Android may also include these fixes.</li>

</ul>
