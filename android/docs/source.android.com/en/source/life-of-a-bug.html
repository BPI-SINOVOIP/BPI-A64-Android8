<p>The Android Open Source Project maintains a public issue tracker where you
can report bugs and request features for the core Android software stack.
(For details on this issue tracker, please see the
<a href="report-bugs.html">Reporting Bugs</a> page).
Reporting bugs is great (thank you!), but what happens to a bug report once
you file it? This page describes the life of a bug.</p>

<p class="note">The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) issue tracker is
intended only for bugs and feature requests related to the core Android
software stack, and is a technical tool for the Open Source community.</p>

<p>This is not a customer support forum. For support information, see the
<a href="https://support.google.com/nexus">Nexus</a> and 
<a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone">Pixel</a> help centers.
Support for other devices is provided by the device manufacturers or by the
carriers selling those devices.</p>

<p>Support for Google applications is through
<a href="http://support.google.com/">Google's support site</a>. Support
for third-party applications is with each application's developer, e.g.
through the contact information provided on Google Play.</p>

<p>Here's the life of a bug, in a nutshell:</p>
<ol>
<li>A bug is filed, and has the state "New".</li>
<li>An AOSP maintainer periodically reviews and triages bugs. Bugs are
triaged into one of four <em>buckets</em>: New, Open, No-Action, or Resolved.</li>
<li>Each bucket includes a number of states that provide more detail on the
fate of the issue.</li>
<li>Bugs marked as "Resolved" will eventually be included in a future
release of the Android software.</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h2 id="bucket-details">Bucket details</h2>
<p>
We use the <strong>Status</strong> field in Issue Tracker to specify the status
of an issue in the resolution process. This is consistent with the definitions
specified in the <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker/concepts/issues#status">Issue
    Tracker documentation</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="new-issues">New issues</h3>
<p>
New issues include bug reports that are not yet being acted upon. The two states
are:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>New:</strong> The bug report has not yet been triaged (that is,
 reviewed by an AOSP maintainer.)</li>
 <li><strong>New + Hotlist:NeedsInfo:</strong> The bug report has insufficient
 information to act upon. The person who reported the bug needs to provide
 additional detail before it can be triaged. If enough time passes and no new
 information is provided, the bug may be closed by default, as one of the
 No-Action states.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="open-issues">Open issues</h3>
<p>
This bucket contains bugs that need action, but which are still unresolved,
pending a change to the source code.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Assigned:</strong> The bug report has been recognized as an
 adequately detailed report of a legitimate issue and the bug has been assigned
 to a specific contributor to assess and analyze.</li>
 <li><strong>Accepted:</strong> The assignee has acknowledged the issue and has
 started to work on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Typically, a bug starts in <strong>Assigned</strong>, and remains there until
someone intends to resolve it, at which point it enters
<strong>Accepted</strong>. However, note that this isn't a guarantee, and it's
not uncommon for bugs to go from <strong>Assigned</strong> to one of the
Resolved states.
</p>
<p>
In general, if a bug is in one of these Open states, the AOSP team has
recognized it as a legitimate issue, and a high-quality contribution fixing that
bug is likely to get accepted. However, it's impossible to guarantee a fix in
time for any particular release.
</p>
<h3 id="no-action-issues">No-Action issues</h3>
<p>
This bucket contains bugs that are deemed to not require any action.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Won't Fix (Not reproducible):</strong> An AOSP contributor attempted
 to reproduce the behavior described, and was unable to do so. This sometimes
 means that the bug is legitimate but simply rare or difficult to reproduce, or
 there was not enough information to fix the issue.</li>
 <li><strong>Won't Fix (Intended behavior):</strong> An AOSP maintainer has
 determined that the behavior described isn't a bug, but is the intended
 behavior. This state is also commonly referred to as <em>working as
 intended</em> (WAI). For feature requests, an AOSP maintainer has determined
 that the request is not going to be implemented in Android.</li>
 <li><strong>Won't Fix (Obsolete):</strong> The issue is no longer relevant due
 to changes in the product.</li>
 <li><strong>Won't Fix (Infeasible):</strong> The changes that are needed to
 address the issue are not reasonably possible. This status is also used for
 issues reported that cannot be handled in AOSP, typically because it is related
 to a customized device or to an external application, or the reporter mistook
 this tracker as a help forum.</li>
 <li><strong>Duplicate:</strong> There was already an identical report in the
 issue tracker. Any actual action will be reported on that report.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resolved-issues">Resolved issues</h3>
<p>
This bucket contains bugs that have had action taken, and are now considered
resolved.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Fixed (verified):</strong> This bug has been fixed, and is included
 in a formal release. When this state is set, we try to also set a property
 indicating which release it was fixed in.</li>
 <li><strong>Fixed:</strong> This bug has been fixed (or feature implemented) in
 a source tree, but might not yet been included in a formal release.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>
<p>
The states and lifecycle above are how we generally try to track software.
However, Android contains a lot of software and gets a correspondingly large
number of bugs. As a result, sometimes bugs don't make it through all the
states in a formal progression. We do try to keep the system up to date, but
we tend to do so in periodic "bug sweeps" where we review the database and
make updates.</p>
