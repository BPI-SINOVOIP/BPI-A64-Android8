<p>The "Android" name, the <img src="/source/assets/images/sac_logo.png"
alt="Android" style="margin:0;padding:0 2px;vertical-align:baseline" /> logo,
the "Google Play" brand, and other trademarks are property of Google Inc. and
not part of the assets available through the Android Open Source Project.</p>

<p>If you are interested in using these brands to indicate their association
with your device, adhere to the guidelines on this page. These guidelines
correspond to and complement the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/promote/brand.html">Brand
Guidelines for Android App Developers</a> and
<a href="https://www.google.com/permissions/">Google Brand Permissions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="brand-android">Android</h2>

<p>Here are manufacturer guidelines for the Android brand and related
assets.</p>

<h3 id="text-android" style="clear:right">Android in text</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Android&trade; should have a trademark symbol the first time it appears in
  a creative.</li>
  <li>"Android" should always be capitalized and is never plural or possessive.
  </li>
  <li>The use of “Android” on hardware, packaging or marketing materials of
  device is restricted to
  <a href="/compatibility/index.html">Android-compatible</a> devices
  only.</li>
  <li>“Android” should never be used in the name of your product or as the
  primary or dominant mark on your packaging or device.</li>
  <li>"Android” should be used only as a term to refer to the operating system
  (OS) of your device. If you are unsure whether your use meets our guidelines,
  follow this simple test: If you can replace "Android" with "the Android
  platform" and the text still makes sense, then you may use this term.
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color:red">Incorrect</span>: "Android XBrand Phone"</li>
    <li><span style="color:green">Correct</span>: "XBrand phone on Android"</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You may use “with Android” in plain black text with your logo. If used
  with your logo, "with Android" should be no larger than 90% of your logo’s
  size. First or most prominent instance of this use should be followed by a
  &trade; symbol.</li>
  <li>Android may be used <em>only as a descriptor</em>, as long as it is
  followed by a proper generic term. It cannot be framed as the product name or
  brand of your device.
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color:red">Incorrect</span>: "Android XBrand Phone"</li>
    <li><span style="color:green">Correct</span>: "Android mobile device"</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Any use of the Android name must include this attribution in your
  communication</strong>:</p>
  <blockquote><em>Android is a trademark of Google Inc.</em></blockquote></p>
  </li>
</ul>
