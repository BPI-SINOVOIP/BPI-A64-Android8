<p>The CTS test results are placed in the file:</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
$CTS_ROOT/android-cts/repository/results/&lt;start_time&gt;.zip
</pre>

<p>If you have built the CTS yourself, <em>$CTS_ROOT</em> will resemble the
path <em>out/host/linux-x86/cts</em> but differ by platform. This reflects the
path where you have uncompressed the prebuilt official CTS <a
href="downloads.html">downloaded</a> from this site.</p>

<p>Inside the zip, the testResult.xml file contains the actual results. Open
this file in any web browser (HTML5 compatible browser recommended) to view the
test results.</p>

<p>If testResult.xml displays a blank page when using the Chrome browser,
<a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags">change
your browser configuration</a> to enable the
<em>--allow-file-access-from-files</em> command line flag.</p>

<h3 id="reading-the-test-results">Reading the test results</h3>

<p>The details of the test results depend on which version of CTS you are
using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CTS v1 for Android 6.0 and earlier</a>
  <li>CTS v2 for Android 7.0 and later</a>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The results are provided to help you
ensure the software remains compatible throughout the development process and
act as a common format for communicating the compatibility status of your
device with other parties.</p>

<h4 id="device-information">Device Information</h4>

<p>In CTS v6.0 and earlier, select Device Information (link above Test Summary) to
view details about the device, firmware (make, model, firmware build,
platform), and device hardware (screen resolution, keypad, screen type). (CTS
v7.0 does not display device information.)</p>

<h4 id="test-summary">Test Summary</h4>

<p>The <em>Test Summary</em> section provides executed test plan details, like
the CTS plan name and execution start and end times. It also presents an
aggregate summary of the number of tests that passed, failed, timed out, or
could not be executed.</p>

  <section class="expandable">
    <h4 class="showalways">Show CTS v1 sample test summary</h4>
    <img src="/compatibility/cts/images/cts-test-summary.png" alt="CTS v1 test summary" id="figure1a" />
    <p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1a.</strong> CTS v1 sample test summary </p>
  </section>


  <section class="expandable">
    <h4 class="showalways">Show CTS v2 sample test summary</h4>
    <img src="/compatibility/cts/images/cts-v2-test-summary.png" alt="CTS v2 test summary" id="figure1b" />
    <p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1b.</strong> CTS v2 sample test summary </p>
  </section>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h4 id="test-report">Test Report</h4>
<p>The next section, the CTS test report,  provides a summary of tests passed per package.</p>

<p>This is followed by details of the actual tests that were executed. The
report lists the test package, test suite, test case, and the executed tests.
It shows the result of the test execution—pass, fail, timed out, or not
executed. In the event of a test failure details are provided to help diagnose
the cause.</p>

<p>Further, the stack trace of the failure is available in the XML file but is
not included in the report to ensure brevity—viewing the XML file with a text
editor should provide details of the test failure (search for the
<em>&lt;Test&gt;</em> tag corresponding to the failed test and look within it
for the <em>&lt;StackTrace&gt;</em> tag).</p>

<h3 id="incomplete-test-modules">Reviewing test_result.xml for incomplete test modules</h3>

<p>
To determine the number of incomplete modules in a given test session, run
command 'list results'. The count of Modules Completed and Total Modules are
listed for each previous session. To determine which modules are complete vs.
incomplete, open the test_result.xml file and read the value of the "done"
attribute for each module in the result report. Modules with value done =
"false" have not run to completion.
