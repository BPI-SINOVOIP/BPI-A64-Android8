<p>Some test groups may need or support special command line options, or require
special care when used on certain systems.</p>

<h2 id=memory_allocation_stress_tests>Memory allocation stress tests</h2>

<p>Memory allocation stress tests exercise out-of-memory conditions by repeatedly
allocating certain resources until the driver reports an out-of-memory error.</p>

<p>On certain platforms, such as Android and most Linux variants, the following
can occur: The operating system may kill the test process instead of allowing a
driver to handle or otherwise provide an out-of-memory error. On such
platforms, tests that are designed to cause out-of-memory errors are disabled
by default, and must be enabled using the  <code>--deqp-test-oom=enable</code> command line argument.
It is recommended that you run such tests manually to
check if the system behaves correctly under resource pressure. However, in such
a situation, a test process crash should be interpreted as a pass.</p>

<h2 id=long-running_rendering_stress_tests>Long-running rendering stress tests</h2>

<p>Rendering stress tests are designed to reveal robustness issues under sustained
rendering load. By default the tests will execute only a few iterations, but
they can be configured to run indefinitely by supplying the <code>--deqp-test-iteration-count=-1</code> command line argument. The test watchdog should be disabled (<code>--deqp-watchdog=disable</code>) when running these tests for a long period of time.</p>
