<p>
  Trade Federation is distributed with the AOSP and uses the Android build system
  to create its binary. Make sure you've <a href="/source/initializing.html"
  >established a build environment</a> to compile and run packages from the
  Android source tree.
</p>

<h2>Build TradeFed</h2>

<p>
  From the root directory of the Android source tree:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">source ./build/make/envsetup.sh</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">lunch &lt;device-target&gt;</code>
<code class="devsite-terminal">make tradefed-all -j8</code>
</pre>

<h2>Run from the Command Line</h2>

<p>
  TradeFed requires the <code>adb</code> utility in your <code>$PATH</code>:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
export PATH=$PATH:&lt;path/to/adb&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  Once TradeFed is built, the <code>tradefed.sh</code> launcher script is
  accessible from your path. To launch the Trade Federation console:
</p>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
tradefed.sh
</pre>
<p>
  Now your environment is set up for Trade Federation.
