<p>This page discusses how to configure ART and its compilation options. Topics addressed here
include configuration of pre-compilation of the system image, dex2oat compilation options,
and how to trade off system partition space, data partition space, and performance.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/index.html">ART
and Dalvik</a>, the <a
href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/dex-format.html">Dalvik
Executable format</a>, and the remaining pages on source.android.com to work
with ART. See <a
href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/verifying-apps-art.html">Verifying
App Behavior on the Android Runtime (ART)</a> to ensure your apps work
properly.</p>

<h2 id=how_art_works>How ART works</h2>

<p>ART uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, and starting in Android 7.0
(Nougat or N), it uses a hybrid combination of AOT, just-in-time (JIT)
compilation, and profile-guided compilation.  The combination of all these
compilation modes is configurable and will be discussed in this section. As an
example, Pixel devices are configured with the following compilation flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>An application is initially installed without any AOT compilation. The
  first few times the application runs, it will be interpreted, and methods
  frequently executed will be JIT compiled.</li>
<li>When the device is idle and charging, a compilation daemon runs to
  AOT-compile frequently used code based on a profile generated during the
  first runs.</li>
<li>The next restart of an application will use the profile-guided code and
  avoid doing JIT compilation at runtime for methods already compiled. Methods
  that get JIT-compiled during the new runs will be added to the profile, which
  will then be picked up by the compilation daemon.</li>
</ol>

<p>ART comprises a compiler (the <code>dex2oat</code> tool) and a runtime
(<code>libart.so</code>) that is loaded for starting the Zygote. The
<code>dex2oat</code> tool takes an APK file and generates one or more
compilation artifact files that the runtime loads. The number of files, their
extensions, and names are subject to change across releases, but as of the
Android O release, the files being generated are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.vdex</code>: contains the uncompressed DEX code of the
  APK, with some additional metadata to speed up verification.</li>
<li><code>.odex</code>: contains AOT compiled code for methods in the
  APK.</li>
<li><code>.art (optional)</code>: contains ART internal
  representations of some strings and classes listed in the APK, used to speed
  application startup. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id=compilation_options>Compilation options</h2>

<p>Compilation options for ART are of two categories:
<ol>
<li>System ROM configuration: what code gets AOT-compiled when building a
  system image.</li>
<li>Runtime configuration: how ART compiles and runs applications on a
  device.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>One core ART option to configure these two categories is <em>compiler
filters</em>. Compiler filters drive how ART compiles DEX code and is an
option passed to the <code>dex2oat</code> tool. Starting in Android O, there
are four officially supported filters:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>verify</em>: only run DEX code verification.</li>
<li><em>quicken</em>: run DEX code verification and optimize some DEX
  instructions to get better interpreter performance.</li>
<li><em>speed</em>: run DEX code verification and AOT-compile all methods.</li>
<li><em>speed-profile</em>: run DEX code verification and AOT-compile methods
  listed in a profile file.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=system_rom>System ROM configuration</h3>

<p>There are a number of ART build options available for configuring a system
ROM. How to configure these options depends on the available storage space for
<code>/system</code> and the number of pre-installed applications. The
JARs/APKs that are compiled into a system ROM can be divided in four
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot classpath code: compiled with the <em>speed</em> compiler filter by
    default.</li>
<li>System server code: compiled with the <em>speed</em> compiler filter by
  default.</li>
<li>Product-specific core applications: compiled with the <em>speed</em>
  compiler filter by default.</li>
<li>All other applications: compiled with the <em>quicken</em> compiler filter
  by default.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id=build_options>Makefile options</h4>
<ul>

<li><code>WITH_DEXPREOPT</code></li>
<p>
Whether <code>dex2oat</code> is invoked on DEX code installed on the system image. Enabled by default.
</p>

<li><code>DONT_DEXPREOPT_PREBUILTS</code> (since Android 5.0)</li>
<p>
Enabling <code>DONT_DEXPREOPT_PREBUILTS</code> prevents the prebuilts from being
pre-optimized. These are apps that have <code>include $(BUILD_PREBUILT)</code>
specified in their <code>Android.mk</code>, such as Gmail. Skipping
pre-optimization of prebuilt apps that are likely to be updated via Google Play
saves <code>/system</code> space but does add to first boot time.
</p>

<li><code>WITH_DEXPREOPT_BOOT_IMG_ONLY</code></li>

<p>Enabling <code>WITH_DEXPREOPT_BOOT_IMG_ONLY</code> pre-optimizes only the
boot classpath.

<li><code>LOCAL_DEX_PREOPT</code></li>

<p>Pre-optimization can also be enabled or disabled on an individual app basis by
specifying the <code>LOCAL_DEX_PREOPT</code> option in the module definition.
This can be useful for disabling pre-optimization of apps that may immediately
receive Google Play updates since the updates would render the pre-optimized
code in the system image obsolete. This is also useful to save space on major
version upgrade OTAs since users may already have newer versions of apps in the
data partition.</p>

<p><code>LOCAL_DEX_PREOPT</code> supports the values ‘true’ or ‘false’ to
enable or disable pre-optimization, respectively. In addition, ‘nostripping’ can
be specified if pre-optimization should not strip the <code>classes.dex</code>
file from the APK or JAR file. Normally this file is stripped since it’s no
longer needed after pre-optimization, but this last option is necessary to
allow third-party APK signatures to remain valid.</p>

<li><code>PRODUCT_DEX_PREOPT_BOOT_FLAGS</code></li>
<p>
Passes options to <code>dex2oat</code> to control how the boot image is
compiled. It can be used to specify customized image classes lists, compiled
classes lists, and compiler filters.
</p>

<li><code>PRODUCT_DEX_PREOPT_DEFAULT_FLAGS</code></li>
<p>
Passes options to <code>dex2oat</code> to control how everything besides the
boot image is compiled.
</p>

<li><code>PRODUCT_DEX_PREOPT_MODULE_CONFIGS</code></li>
<p>
Provides the ability to pass <code>dex2oat</code> options for a particular
module and product configuration. It is set in a product’s
<code>device.mk</code> file by <code>$(call add-product-dex-preopt-module-config,&lt;modules&gt;,&lt;option&gt;)</code>
where <code>&lt;modules&gt;</code> is a list of LOCAL_MODULE and LOCAL_PACKAGE names
for JAR and APK files, respectively.
</p>

<li><code>PRODUCT_DEXPREOPT_SPEED_APPS (New in Android O)</code></li>
<p>
List of applications that have been identified as core to the products and
which are desirable to compile with the <em>speed</em> compiler filter. For
example, persistent apps such as SystemUI get a chance to use
profile-guided compilation only at the next reboot, so it may be better for the
product to have these apps always AOT-compiled.
</p>

<li><code>PRODUCT_SYSTEM_SERVER_APPS (New in Android O)</code></li>
<p>
List of applications that are loaded by the system server. These applications
will be compiled by default with the <em>speed</em> compiler filter.
</p>

<li><code>PRODUCT_ART_TARGET_INCLUDE_DEBUG_BUILD(Post Android O)</code></li>
<p>
Whether to include a debug version of ART on the device. By default, this is
enabled for userdebug and eng builds. The behavior can be overridden by explicitly
setting the option to <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.
</p>
<p>
By default, the device will use the non-debug version (<em>libart.so</em>).
To switch, set the system property <code>persist.sys.dalvik.vm.lib.2</code> to
<em>libartd.so</em>.
</p>

<li><code>WITH_DEXPREOPT_PIC (Removed in Android O)</code></li>

<p>In Android 5.1.0 through Android 6.0.1, <code>WITH_DEXPREOPT_PIC</code> can
be specified to enable position-independent code (PIC). With this, compiled
code from the image doesn’t have to be relocated from /system into
/data/dalvik-cache, saving space in the data partition. However, there is a
slight runtime impact because it disables an optimization that takes advantage
of position-dependent code.  Typically, devices wanting to save space in /data
should enable PIC compilation.</p>

<p>In Android 7.0, PIC compilation was enabled by default.</p>

</ul>



<h4 id=boot_classpath>Boot classpath configuration</h4>

<ul>
<li>Preloaded Classes List</li>

<p>The preloaded classes list is a list of classes the zygote will initialize on
startup. This saves each app from having to run these class initializers
separately, allowing them to start up faster and share pages in memory. The
preloaded classes list file is located at frameworks/base/preloaded-classes by
default, and it contains a list that is tuned for typical phone use. This may
be different for other devices, such as wearables, and should be tuned
accordingly. Be careful when tuning this since adding too many classes wastes
memory loading unused classes; meanwhile, adding too few forces each app to
have to have its own copy, again wasting memory.</p>

<p>Example usage (in product’s device.mk):</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
PRODUCT_COPY_FILES += &lt;filename&gt;:system/etc/preloaded-classes
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This line must be placed before
inheriting any product configuration makefiles that get the default one from:
<code>build/target/product/base.mk</code></p>

<li>Image Classes List</li>

<p>The image classes list is a list of classes that dex2oat initializes ahead of
time and stores in the boot.art file. This allows the zygote to load these
results out of the boot.art file on startup instead of running the initializers
for these classes itself during preloading. A key feature of this is that the
pages loaded from the image and shared between processes can be clean, allowing
them to be swapped out easily in low-memory situations. In L, by default the
image classes list uses the same list as the preloaded classes list. Beginning
post-L in AOSP, a custom image classes list can be specified using:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
PRODUCT_DEX_PREOPT_BOOT_FLAGS
</pre>

<p>Example use (in product’s <code>device.mk</code>):</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
PRODUCT_DEX_PREOPT_BOOT_FLAGS += --image-classes=&lt;filename&gt;
</pre>

<li>Compiled Classes List</li>

<p>In post-L AOSP, a subset of classes from the boot classpath can be specified to
be compiled during pre-optimization using the compiled classes list. This can
be a useful option for devices that are very tight on space and can’t fit the
entire pre-optimized boot image. However, note classes not specified by this
list will not be compiled - not even on the device - and must be interpreted,
potentially affecting runtime performance. By default, dex2oat will look for a
compiled classes list in $OUT/system/etc/compiled-classes, so a custom one can
be copied to that location by the device.mk. A particular file location can
also be specified using:

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
PRODUCT_DEX_PREOPT_BOOT_FLAGS
</pre>

<p>Example usage (in product’s <code>device.mk</code>):</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
PRODUCT_COPY_FILES += &lt;filename&gt;:system/etc/compiled-classes
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This line must be placed before
inheriting any product configuration makefiles that get the default one from:
<code>build/target/product/base.mk</code></p>
</ul>

<h3 id=runtime_configuration>Runtime configuration</h3>

<h4 id=undefined>Jit options</h4>

<p>The following options affect Android releases only where the ART JIT compiler
is available.</p>

<ul>
<li>dalvik.vm.usejit: whether or not the JIT is enabled.</li>
<li>dalvik.vm.jitinitialsize (default 64K): the initial capacity
of the code cache. The code cache will regularly GC and increase if needed.
<li>dalvik.vm.jitmaxsize (default 64M): the maximum capacity of the code cache.
<li>dalvik.vm.jitthreshold: (default 10000) - This
is the threshold that the "hotness" counter of a method needs to pass in order
for the method to be JIT compiled. The "hotness" counter is a metric internal
to the runtime. It includes the number of calls, backward branches, and other
factors.
<li>dalvik.vm.usejitprofiles: whether or not
JIT profiles are enabled; this may be used even if dalvik.vm.usejit is false.
Note that if this is false, the compiler filter <em>speed-profile</em> does
not AOT-compile any method and is equivalent to <em>quicken</em>.
<li>dalvik.vm.jitprithreadweight (default to
dalvik.vm.jitthreshold / 20) - The weight of the JIT "samples"
(see jitthreshold) for the application UI thread. Use to speed up compilation
of methods that directly affect users experience when interacting with the
app.
<li>dalvik.vm.jittransitionweight: (default to dalvik.vm.jitthreshold / 10)
the weight of the method
invocation that transitions between compile code and interpreter. This helps
make sure the methods involved are compiled to minimize transitions (which are
expensive).
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id=undefined>Package manager options</h4>

<p>
Since Android 7.0, there's a generic way to specify the level of
compilation/verification that happened at various stages.
The compilation levels can be configured via system properties
with the defaults being:
</p>

<ul>
<li>pm.dexopt.install=quicken</li>
<p>This is the compilation filter used when installing applications through Google
Play. For faster installs, try the <em>quicken</em> compiler filter.
</p>
<li>pm.dexopt.bg-dexopt=speed-profile</li>
<p>
This is the compilation filter used when the device is idle, charging and
fully charged.  Try the <em>speed-profile</em> compiler filter
to take advantage of profile-guided compilation and save on storage.
</p>
<li>pm.dexopt.boot=verify</li>
<p>
The compilation filter used after an over-the-air update. We
<strong>strongly</strong> recommend the <em>verify</em> compiler filter for this
option to avoid very long boot times.
</p>
<li>pm.dexopt.first-boot=quicken<li>
<p>
The compilation filter for the first time the device ever boots. The filter
used here will only affect the boot time after factory. We recommend the filter
<em>quicken</em> for it to avoid long times before a user gets to
use the phone for the very first time. Note that if all applications in
<code>/system</code> are already compiled with the <em>quicken</em> compiler
filter or are compiled with the <em>speed</em> or <em>speed-profile</em>
compiler filter, the <code>pm.dexopt.first-boot</code> has no effect.
</p>

</ul>

<h4 id=undefined>Dex2oat options</h4>


<p>Note that these options affect <code>dex2oat</code>
during on-device compilation as well as during pre-optimization, whereas most
of the options discussed above affect only pre-optimization.</p>

<p>To control <code>dex2oat</code> while it’s compiling the boot image:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dalvik.vm.image-dex2oat-Xms: initial heap size
  <li>dalvik.vm.image-dex2oat-Xmx: maximum heap size
  <li>dalvik.vm.image-dex2oat-filter: compiler filter option
  <li>dalvik.vm.image-dex2oat-threads: number of threads to use
</ul>

<p>To control <code>dex2oat</code> while it’s compiling everything besides the boot image:</p>

<ul>
  <li>dalvik.vm.dex2oat-Xms: initial heap size
  <li>dalvik.vm.dex2oat-Xmx: maximum heap size
  <li>dalvik.vm.dex2oat-filter: compiler filter option
</ul>

<p>On releases through Android 6.0, one additional option is provided for compiling everything
besides the boot image:</p>
<ul>
  <li>dalvik.vm.dex2oat-threads: number of threads to use
</ul>

<p>Starting with Android 6.1, this becomes two additional options for compiling everything besides
the boot image:</p>
<ul>
  <li>dalvik.vm.boot-dex2oat-threads: number of threads to use during boot time
  <li>dalvik.vm.dex2oat-threads: number of threads to use after boot time
</ul>

<p>Starting with Android 7.1, two options are provided for controlling how memory is used when
compiling everything besides the boot image:</p>
<ul>
  <li>dalvik.vm.dex2oat-very-large: minimum total dex file size in bytes to disable AOT compilation
  <li>dalvik.vm.dex2oat-swap: use dex2oat swap file (for low-memory devices)
</ul>

<p>The options that control initial and maximum heap size for
<code>dex2oat</code> should not be reduced since they could limit what
applications can be compiled.</p>

<h2 id=other_odex>A/B specific configuration</h2>

<h3 id=undefined>ROM configuration</h3>

<p>Starting in Android 7.0, devices may use two system partitions to enable
<a href="/devices/tech/ota/ab_updates.html">A/B system updates</a>.
To save on the system partition size, the preopted files can be installed in
the unused second system partition. They are then copied to the data partition
on first boot.</p>

<p>Example usage (in <code>device-common.mk</code>):</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += \
     cppreopts.sh
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES += \
     ro.cp_system_other_odex=1
</pre>

<p>And in device's <code>BoardConfig.mk</code>:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
BOARD_USES_SYSTEM_OTHER_ODEX := true
</pre>

<p>
Note that boot classpath code, system server code, and product-specific core
applications always compile to the system partition. By default, all other
applications get compiled to the unused second system partition. This can be
controlled with the <code>SYSTEM_OTHER_ODEX_FILTER</code>, which has a value by
default of:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
SYSTEM_OTHER_ODEX_FILTER ?= app/% priv-app/%
</pre>

<h3 id=undefined>Background dexopt OTA</h3>

<p>With A/B enabled devices, applications can be compiled in the background for
updating to the new system image. See <a
href="/devices/tech/ota/ab_updates.html#compilation">App compilation in
background</a> to optionally include the compilation script and
binaries in the system image. The compilation filter used for this compilation
is controlled with:</p>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
pm.dexopt.ab-ota=speed-profile
</pre>

<p>
We recommend using <em>speed-profile</em> to take advantage of profile guided
compilation and save on storage.
