<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> If you've never used systrace
before, we strongly recommend reading the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/systrace.html">systrace
overview</a> before continuing.</p>

<p>systrace is the primary tool for analyzing Android device performance.
However, it's really a wrapper around other tools: It is the host-side wrapper
around <em>atrace</em>, the device-side executable that controls userspace
tracing and sets up <em>ftrace</em>, the primary tracing mechanism in the Linux
kernel. systrace uses atrace to enable tracing, then reads the ftrace buffer and
wraps it all in a self-contained HTML viewer. (While newer kernels have support
for Linux Enhanced Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), the following documentation
pertains to the 3.18 kernel (no eFPF) as that's what was used on the Pixel/Pixel
XL.)</p>

<p>systrace is owned by the Google Android and Google Chrome teams and is
developed in the open as part of the
<a href="https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult">Catapult project</a>. In
addition to systrace, Catapult includes other useful utilities. For example,
ftrace has more features than can be directly enabled by systrace or atrace and
contains some advanced functionality that is critical to debugging performance
problems. (These features require root access and often a new kernel.)</p>

<h2 id="running_systrace">Running systrace</h2>
<p>When debugging jitter on Pixel/Pixel XL, start with the following
command:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
./systrace.py sched freq idle am wm gfx view sync binder_driver irq workq input -b 96000
</pre>

<p>When combined with the additional tracepoints required for GPU and display
pipeline activity, this gives you the ability to trace from user input to frame
displayed on screen. Set the buffer size to something large to avoid
losing events (which usually manifests as some CPUs containing no events after
some point in the trace).</p>

<p>When going through systrace, keep in mind that <strong>every event is
triggered by something on the CPU</strong>.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Hardware interrupts are not controlled by
the CPU and do trigger things in ftrace, but the actual commit to the trace log
is done by the interrupt handler, which could have been delayed if your
interrupt arrived while (for example) some other bad driver had interrupts
disabled. The critical element is the CPU.</p>

<p>Because systrace is built on top of ftrace and ftrace runs on the CPU,
something on the CPU must write the ftrace buffer that logs hardware changes.
This means that if you're curious about why a display fence changed state, you
can see what was running on the CPU at the exact point of its transition
(something that is running on the CPU triggered that change in the log). This
concept is the foundation of analyzing performance using systrace.</p>

<h2 id="example_1">Example: Working frame</h2>
<p>This example describes a systrace for a normal UI pipeline. To follow along
with the example, <a href="perf_traces.zip">download the zip file</a> of traces
(which also includes other traces referred to in this section), upzip the file,
and open the systrace_tutorial.html file in your browser. Be warned this
systrace is a large file; unless you use systrace in your day-to-day work, this
is likely a much bigger trace with much more information than you've ever seen
in a single trace before.</p>
<p>For a consistent, periodic workload such as TouchLatency, the UI pipeline
contains the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>EventThread in SurfaceFlinger wakes the app UI thread, signaling it's time
to render a new frame.</li>
<li>App renders frame in UI thread, RenderThread, and hwuiTasks, using CPU and
GPU resources. This is the bulk of the capacity spent for UI.</li>
<li>App sends rendered frame to SurfaceFlinger via binder and goes to
sleep.</li>
<li>A second EventThread in SurfaceFlinger wakes SurfaceFlinger to trigger
composition and display output. If SurfaceFlinger determines there is no work to
be done, it goes back to sleep.</li>
<li>SurfaceFlinger handles composition via HWC/HWC2 or GL. HWC/HWC2 composition
is faster and lower power but has limitations depending on the SOC. This usually
takes ~4-6ms, but can overlap with step 2 because Android applications are
always triple-buffered. (While applications are always triple-buffered, there
may only be one pending frame waiting in SurfaceFlinger, which makes it appear
identical to double-buffering.)</li>
<li>SurfaceFlinger dispatches final output to display via vendor driver and goes
back to sleep, waiting for EventThread wakeup.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's walk through the frame beginning at 15409ms:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_normal_pipeline.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Normal UI pipeline,
EventThread running.</p>

<p>Figure 1 is a normal frame surrounded by normal frames, so it's a good
starting point for understanding how the UI pipeline works. The UI thread row
for TouchLatency includes different colors at different times. Bars denote
different states for the thread:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gray</strong>. Sleeping.</li>
<li><strong>Blue</strong>. Runnable (it could run, but the scheduler hasn't
picked it to run yet).</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong>. Actively running (the scheduler thinks it's
running).
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Interrupt handlers aren't shown in the
normal per-CPU timeline, so it's possible that you're actually running interrupt
handlers or softirqs during some portion of a thread's runtime. Check the irq
section of the trace (under process 0) to confirm whether an interrupt is
running instead of a standard thread.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Red</strong>. Uninterruptible sleep (generally sleeping on a lock
in the kernel). Can be indicative of I/O load. Extremely useful for debugging
performance issues.</li>
<li><strong>Orange</strong>. Uninterruptible sleep due to I/O load.</li>
</ul>

<p>To view the reason for uninterruptible sleep (available from the
<code>sched_blocked_reason</code> tracepoint), select the red uninterruptible
sleep slice.</p>
<p>While EventThread is running, the UI thread for TouchLatency becomes
runnable. To see what woke it, click the blue section:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_tl.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> UI thread for
TouchLatency.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the TouchLatency UI thread was woken by tid 6843, which
corresponds to EventThread. The UI thread wakes:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_wake_render_enqueue.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> UI thread wakes, renders a
frame, and enqueues it for SurfaceFlinger to consume.</p>

<p>If the <code>binder_driver</code> tag is enabled in a trace, you can select a
binder transaction to view information on all of the processes involved in that
transaction:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_binder_trans.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Binder transaction.</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows that, at 15,423.65ms, Binder:6832_1 in SurfaceFlinger becomes
runnable because of tid 9579, which is TouchLatency's RenderThread. You can also
see queueBuffer on both sides of the binder transaction.</p>

<p>During the queueBuffer on the SurfaceFlinger side, the number of pending
frames from TouchLatency goes from 1 to 2:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_pending_frames.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 5.</strong> Pending frames goes from 1 to
2.</p>

<p>Figure 5 shows triple-buffering, where there are two completed frames and the
app will soon start rendering a third. This is because we've already dropped
some frames, so the app keeps two pending frames instead of one to try to avoid
further dropped frames.</p>

<p>Soon after, SurfaceFlinger's main thread is woken by a second EventThread so
it can output the older pending frame to the display:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_sf_woken_et.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 6.</strong> SurfaceFlinger's main thread
is woken by a second EventThread.</p>

<p>SurfaceFlinger first latches the older pending buffer, which causes the
pending buffer count to decrease from 2 to 1:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_sf_latches_pend.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 7.</strong> SurfaceFlinger first latches
the older pending buffer.</p>

<p>After latching the buffer, SurfaceFlinger sets up composition and submits the
final frame to the display. (Some of these sections are enabled as part of the
<code>mdss</code> tracepoint, so they may not be there on your SOC.)</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_sf_comp_submit.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 8.</strong> SurfaceFlinger sets up
composition and submits the final frame.</p>

<p>Next, <code>mdss_fb0</code> wakes on CPU 0. <code>mdss_fb0</code> is the
display pipeline's kernel thread for outputting a rendered frame to the display.
We can see <code>mdss_fb0</code> as its own row in the trace (scroll down to
view).</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_wake_cpu0.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 9.</strong> <code>mdss_fb0</code> wakes
on CPU 0.</p>

<p><code>mdss_fb0</code> wakes up, runs for a bit, enters uninterruptible sleep,
then wakes again.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: From this point forward, the trace is
more complicated as the final work is split between <code>mdss_fb0</code>,
interrupts, and workqueue functions. If you need that level of detail, refer to
the exact characteristics of the driver stack for your SOC (as what happens on
the Pixel XL might not be useful to you).</p>

<h2 id="example_2">Example: Non-working frame</h2>
<p>This example describes a systrace used to debug Pixel/Pixel XL jitter. To
follow along with the example, <a href="/devices/tech/debug/perf_traces.zip">download the zip
file</a> of traces (which also includes other traces referred to in this
section), upzip the file, and open the systrace_tutorial.html file in your
browser.</p>

<p>When you first open the systrace, you'll see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_tl_pxl.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 10</strong>. TouchLatency running on Pixel
XL (most options enabled, including mdss and kgsl tracepoints).</p>

<p>When looking for jank, check the FrameMissed row under SurfaceFlinger.
FrameMissed is a quality-of-life improvement provided by Hardware Composer 2
(HWC2). As of December 2016, HWC2 is used only on Pixel/Pixel XL; when viewing
systrace for other devices, the FrameMissed row may not be present. In either
case, FrameMissed is correlated with SurfaceFlinger missing one of its
extremely-regular runtimes and an unchanged pending-buffer count for the app
(<code>com.prefabulated.touchlatency</code>) at a vsync:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_fm_sf.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 11</strong>. FrameMissed correlation with
SurfaceFlinger.</p>

<p>Figure 11 shows a missed frame at 15598.29ms. SurfaceFlinger woke briefly at
the vsync interval and went back to sleep without doing any work, which means
SurfaceFlinger determined it was not worth trying to send a frame to the display
again. Why?</p>

<p>To understand how the pipeline broke down for this frame, first review the
working frame example above to see how a normal UI pipeline appears in systrace.
When ready, return to the missed frame and work backwards. Notice that
SurfaceFlinger wakes and immediately goes to sleep. When viewing the number of
pending frames from TouchLatency, there are two frames (a good clue to help
figure out what's going on).</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_sf_wake_sleep.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 12.</strong> SurfaceFlinger wakes and
immediately goes to sleep.</p>

<p>Because we have frames in SurfaceFlinger, it's not an app issue. In addition,
SurfaceFlinger is waking at the correct time, so it's not a SurfaceFlinger
issue. If SurfaceFlinger and the app are both looking normal, it's probably a
driver issue.</p>

<p>Because the <code>mdss</code> and <code>sync</code> tracepoints are enabled,
we can get information about the fences (shared between the display driver and
SurfaceFlinger) that control when frames are actually submitted to the display.
The fences we care about are listed under <code>mdss_fb0_retire</code>, which
denotes when a frame is actually on the display. These fences are provided as
part of the <code>sync</code> trace category. Which fences correspond to
particular events in SurfaceFlinger depends on your SOC and driver stack, so
work with your SOC vendor to understand the meaning of fence categories in your
traces.</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_traces_fences.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 13.</strong> <code>mdss_fb0_retire</code>
fences.</p>

<p>Figure 13 shows a frame that was displayed for 33ms, not 16.7ms as expected.
Halfway through that slice, that frame should have been replaced by a new one
but wasn't. View the previous frame and look for anything interesting:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_frame_previous.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 14.</strong> Frame previous to busted
frame.</p>

<p>Figure 14 shows 14.482ms a frame. The busted two-frame segment was 33.6ms,
which is roughly what we would expect for two frames (we render at 60Hz, 16.7ms
a frame, which is close). But 14.482ms is not anywhere close to 16.7ms, which
suggests that something is very wrong with the display pipe.</p>

<p>Investigate exactly where that fence ends to determine what controls it:</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_fence_end.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 15.</strong> Investigate fence end.</p>

<p>A workqueue contains a <code>__vsync_retire_work_handler</code> that is
running when the fence changes. Looking through the kernel source, you can see
it's part of the display driver. It definitely appears to be on the critical
path for the display pipeline, so it must run as quickly as possible. It's
runnable for 70us or so (not a long scheduling delay), but it's a workqueue and
might not get scheduled accurately.</p>

<p>Check the previous frame to determine if that contributed; sometimes jitter
can add up over time and eventually cause us to miss a deadline.</p>

<p><img src="/devices/tech/debug/images/perf_trace_previous_frame.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 16.</strong> Previous frame.</p>

<p>The runnable line on the kworker isn't visible because the viewer turns it
white when it's selected, but the statistics tell the story: 2.3ms of scheduler
delay for part of the display pipeline critical path is <strong>bad</strong>.
Before we do anything else, we should fix that by moving this part of the
display pipeline critical path from a workqueue (which runs as a
<code>SCHED_OTHER</code> CFS thread) to a dedicated <code>SCHED_FIFO</code>
kthread. This function needs timing guarantees that workqueues can't (and aren't
intended to) provide.</p>

<p>Is this the reason for the jank? It's hard to say conclusively. Outside of
easy-to-diagnose cases such as kernel lock contention causing display-critical
threads to sleep, traces usually won't tell you directly what the problem is.
Could this jitter have been the cause of the dropped frame? Absolutely. The
fence times should be 16.7ms, but they aren't close to that at all in the frames
leading up to the dropped frame. (There's a 19ms fence followed by a 14ms
fence.) Given how tightly coupled the display pipeline is, it's entirely
possible the jitter around fence timings resulted in an eventual dropped
frame.</p>

<p>In this example, the solution involved converting
<code>__vsync_retire_work_handler</code> from a workqueue to a dedicated
kthread. This resulted in noticeable jitter improvements and reduced jank in the
bouncing ball test. Subsequent traces show fence timings that hover very close
to 16.7ms.</p>
