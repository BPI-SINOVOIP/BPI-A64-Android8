<p>
Android 7.1.1 and later offer system-level support for retail mode so
users may readily examine the devices in action. This feature enables anyone in
a retail environment to get a quick, safe, and consistent demonstration of an
Android device and significantly reduce the cost and complexity of a retail mode
for OEMs so that demonstration units are commonplace.
</p>

<h2 id="key-use-cases">Key use cases</h2>

<ul>
<li>Any off-the-shelf Android device can be set to retail mode by adding a
single demo video to the build.
<li>All devices have a video highlighting the unique features of the device.
<li>Devices work in both online and offline environments.
<li>Device are self maintaining, requiring minimal interaction by
employees.</li></ul>

<h2 id="lifecycle">Lifecycle</h2>

<h3 id="setup-wizard-suw">Setup Wizard (SUW)</h3>

<p>
Retail employees can enable retail mode directly from the first screen of any setup
wizard by selecting the language <strong>Retail demo</strong> at the bottom of
the list. This option is available for new devices shipped fresh from the
factory. Once a consumer setup has completed, retail mode may no longer be
available.  Once selected, the device finishes SUW with an abbreviated flow.

<h3 id="guest-session">Guest session</h3>

<p>
When the device enters retail mode, it switches to a new demo user and
automatically starts the custom launcher specified in the overlay resource
(described under Implementation).  By default, this custom launcher plays the
demo video on repeat until the user touches the screen to begin a guest session.
At that time, the custom launcher starts the system launcher and then exits.
OEMs can alter the custom launcher to additionally launch another service or
activity on exit. See the <em>Implementation</em> section for details.
</p>

<p>
In order to maintain the integrity of retail mode, keyguard is disabled and
certain actions from Quick Settings that could adversely affect retail mode are
also disallowed, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Airplane mode toggle
  <li>Removing or modifying Wi-Fi access points (Settings)
  <li>Changing carrier (Settings)
  <li>Configuring hotspot (Settings)
  <li>User switching
</ul>

<p>
Additionally, access is also blocked to some global settings that can affect
retail mode by disabling:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wi-Fi settings
  <li>Cellular network configuration options, particularly hotspots
  <li>Bluetooth configuration
  <li>Backup & Reset, Date & Time, and Mobile Networks (they do not show up at
all)
</ul>

<p>
If the user is idle for some period of time (90 seconds by default), retail mode
will show a system dialog to prompt the user to either exit the session or
continue. If the user chooses to exit or if there's no response for five
seconds, retail mode kills/wipes the current demo user, switches to a new demo
user, and loops through the original video again. If someone turns off the
screen using the power button, it comes back on automatically after a few
seconds.
</p>

<p>
After exiting a demo session, devices mute themselves and reset some global
settings, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Brightness
  <li>Auto-rotation
  <li>Flashlight
  <li>Language
  <li>Accessibility</li></ul>

<h3 id="exiting-retail-mode">Exiting retail mode</h3>

<p>
In order to exit retail mode, retail employees must factory reset the device
from the boot loader.

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<h3 id="enabling-retaildemomodeservice">Enabling RetailDemoModeService</h3>

<p>
Setup wizard sets a Global setting <code>Global.DEVICE_DEMO_MODE=true</code> to
indicate that the device has entered retail mode. Upon seeing this setting,
<code>RetailDemoModeService</code> creates and switches to demo user when user 0
is started, enables the custom launcher specified in an overlay resource, and
disables SUW.  System Server and SystemUI also use this flag to manage aspects
of retail mode.
</p>

<h3 id="setting-custom-launcher-or-video-player">Setting custom launcher or
video player</h3>

<p>
An OEM specifies a custom launcher by overriding the framework resource
<code>config_demoModeLauncherComponent</code> specified in:
<code>/frameworks/base/core/res/res/config.xml</code>
</p>

<p>
For example, with:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
&lt;!-- Component that is the default launcher when Retail Mode is enabled. --&gt;
&lt;string name="config_demoModeLauncherComponent"&gt;com.android.retaildemo/.DemoPlayer&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The retail demo DemoPlayer app located at
<code>/packages/apps/RetailDemo</code> is the default custom launcher in the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP).  The app looks for a video in
<code>/data/preloads/demo/retail_demo.mp4</code> and plays it in a loop. When
the user touches the screen, the custom launcher disables its activity
component, which results in the default system launcher starting up.
</p>

<p>The custom launcher must have its custom component marked as disabled by default so that it
doesn't show up in non-demo scenarios. In the demo scenario, System Server
enables the specified <code>config_demoModeLauncherComponent</code> when
starting a new demo session.
</p>

<p>
Setup wizard also looks for the above video to provide an affordance to enter
retail mode. SUW can be modified to look for some other OEM-specific sign that
retail mode is supported if the video is not a part of the demo.
</p>

<p>
If there are system A/B partitions, the system B partition must contain the demo
video at <code>/preloads/demo</code>. This gets copied to
<code>/data/preloads/demo</code> on first boot.
</p>

<p>
To set retail mode-specific settings, use:
<code>Settings.Global.retail_demo_mode_constants</code>. E.g.:
<code>user_inactivity_timeout_ms=90000,warning_dialog_timeout_ms=10000</code>
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> 90000 milliseconds is the current
timeout default but is configurable.
</p>

<h3 id="finding-sample-images">Finding sample images</h3>

<p>
This feature places sample photos in a special folder that is visible to any
gallery app. The photos are available only in demo mode and cannot be modified
by the demo user as they are in a protected directory.
</p>

<h3 id="preventing-google-accounts">Preventing Google accounts</h3>

<p>
Certain restrictions are set in the guest user, similar to managed
device/profile policies that prevent apps and users from performing certain
operations. One of these restrictions is <code>DISALLOW_MODIFY_ACCOUNTS</code>.
With this restriction, AccountManager and Settings do not allow the addition of
accounts. Some Google apps react to this restriction and show an error message,
and others will not prompt for an account (such as YouTube and Photos).
</p>

<p>
OEM apps should also check if <code>DISALLOW_MODIFY_ACCOUNTS</code> is set. But this is a
general problem not unique to retail mode. It is likely already solved for
enterprise use cases.
</p>

<h3 id="customizing-the-system-launcher">Customizing the system launcher</h3>

<p>
OEMs are free to choose their layout but should include apps that function well
on the home screen and hotseat.
</p>

<h3 id="Customizing-built-in-apps">Customizing built-in apps for retail demo mode</h3>

<p>
Built-in apps may have their experience for retail demo mode customized by
calling the API <code>UserManager.isDemoUser()</code> to see if the app is
launched in a demo environment.
</p>

<h3 id="following-demo-video-guidelines">Following demo video guidelines</h3>

<p>
Demonstration videos should be in portrait layout (or natural orientation of the
device, if tablet) and can be any length greater than five seconds. Content
should not result in burn-in, since it will be played 24/7 when on display.
</p>

<h2 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h2>

<h3 id="bringing-the-device-out-of-retail-mode">Bringing the device out of
retail mode</h3>

<p>
This can be done only by factory resetting from the boot loader.
</p>

<h3 id="auto-ota-of-system-software">Auto-OTA of system software</h3>

<p>
By default, when retail mode is enabled, device policy is set to over-the-air
(OTA) update automatically. Retail devices will download, reboot, and install
the update (respecting battery thresholds) without confirmation even if it is
marked as optional.
</p>

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong>
If using System A/B partitions for OTA, once an OTA is received, the device
cannot find original retail mode resources in the System B partition. So any
subsequent factory reset will result in an inability to go back into retail
mode.
</p>

<h3 id="updating-demo-video-via-the-web">Updating demo video via the web</h3>

<p>
The RetailDemo app in <code>/packages/apps/RetailDemo</code> has the ability to
update the demo video if there is network connectivity. The URL to download the
video from can be configured by overriding the following string value in the
RetailDemo app:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
&lt;!-- URL where the retail demo video can be downloaded from. --&gt;
&lt;string name="retail_demo_video_download_url"&gt;&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>

<p>
If different videos need to be used in different regions, then different
download URLs can be configured by using locale-specific string resources
<code>res/values-*/strings.xml. </code>For example, if different videos need to
be used in the U.S. and the U.K., then corresponding download URLs can be placed
in <code>res/values-en-rUS/strings.xml</code> and
<code>res/values-en-rGB/strings.xml</code>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
In <code>res/values-en-rUS/strings.xml</code>:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
&lt;string name="retail_demo_video_download_url"&gt;download URL for US video goes here&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>

<p>
And similarly in <code>res/values-en-rGB/strings.xml</code>:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
&lt;string name="retail_demo_video_download_url"&gt;download URL for UK video goes here&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>

<p>
This video will be downloaded at most once per every device reboot. When the
video on the device is being played, RetailDemo app will check in the background
if the download URL is provided and the video at the URL is newer than the one
being played.

<p>
If so, RetailDemo app will download this video and start playing
it. Once this video is downloaded, the downloaded video will be used for playing
in the demo sessions going forward. None of the checks happen again until after
next reboot.
