<p>
  A/B system updates, also known as seamless updates, ensure a workable booting
  system remains on the disk during an <a href="/devices/tech/ota/index.html"
  >over-the-air (OTA) update</a>. This reduces the likelihood of an inactive
  device afterward, which means less device replacements and device reflashes at
  repair/warranty centers.
</p>

<p>
  Customers can continue to use their devices during an OTA. The only downtime
  during an update is when the device reboots into the updated disk partition. If
  the OTA fails, the device is still useable since it will boot into the pre-OTA
  disk partition. The download of the OTA can be attempted again. A/B system
  updates implemented through OTA are recommended for new devices only.
</p>

<p>
  A/B system updates affect:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interactions with the bootloader</li>
  <li>Partition selection</li>
  <li>The build process</li>
  <li>OTA update package generation</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The existing <a href="/security/verifiedboot/dm-verity.html"
  >dm-verity</a> feature guarantees the device will boot an uncorrupted image. If
  a device doesn't boot, because of a bad OTA or dm-verity issue, the device can
  reboot into an old image.
</p>

<p>
  The A/B system is robust because any errors (such as I/O errors) affect only
  the <strong>unused</strong> partition set and can be retried. Such errors also
  become less likely because the I/O load is deliberately low to avoid degrading
  the user experience.
</p>

<p>
  OTA updates can occur while the system is running, without interrupting the
  user. This includes the app optimizations that occur after a reboot.
  Additionally, the cache partition is no longer used to store OTA update
  packages; there is no need for sizing the cache partition.
</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
  A/B system updates use a background daemon called <code>update_engine</code>
  and two sets of partitions. The two sets of partitions are referred to as
  <em>slots</em>, normally as slot A and slot B. The system runs from one slot,
  the <em>current</em> slot, while the partitions in the <em>unused</em> slot are
  not accessed by the running system (for normal operation).
</p>

<p>
  The goal of this feature is to make updates fault resistant by keeping the
  unused slot as a fallback. If there is an error during an update or immediately
  after an update, the system can rollback to the old slot and continue to have a
  working system. To achieve this goal, none of the partitions used by the
  <em>current</em> slot should be updated as part of the OTA update (including
  partitions for which there is only one copy).
</p>

<p>
  Each slot has a <em>bootable</em> attribute, which states whether the slot
  contains a correct system from which the device can boot. The current slot is
  clearly bootable when the system is running, but the other slot may have an old
  (still correct) version of the system, a newer version, or invalid data.
  Regardless of what the <em>current</em> slot is, there is one slot which is the
  <em>active</em> or preferred slot. The active slot is the one the bootloader
  will boot from on the next boot. Finally, each slot has a <em>successful</em>
  attribute set by the user space, which is only relevant if the slot is also
  bootable.
</p>

<p>
  A successful slot should be able to boot, run, and update itself. A bootable
  slot that was not marked as successful (after several attempts were made to
  boot from it) should be marked as unbootable by the bootloader, including
  changing the active slot to another bootable slot (normally to the slot running
  right before the attempt to boot into the new, active one). The specific
  details of the interface are defined in
  <code><a class="external-link" target="_blank"
           href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/libhardware/+/master/include/hardware/boot_control.h"
        >boot_control.h</a></code>.
</p>

<h3 id="bootloader-state-examples">Bootloader state examples</h3>

<p>
  The <code>boot_control</code> HAL is used by <code>update_engine</code> (and
  possibly other daemons) to instruct the bootloader what to boot from. These
  are common example scenarios and their associated states:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Normal case</strong>: The system is running from its current slot,
    either slot A or B. No updates have been applied so far. The system's current
    slot is bootable, successful, and the active slot.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Update in progress</strong>: The system is running from slot B, so
    slot B is the bootable, successful, and active slot. Slot A was marked as
    unbootable since the contents of slot A are being updated but not yet
    completed. A reboot in this state should continue booting from slot B.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Update applied, reboot pending</strong>: The system is running from
    slot B, slot B is bootable and successful, but slot A was marked as active
    (and therefore is marked as bootable). Slot A is not yet marked as successful
    and some number of attempts to boot from slot A should be made by the
    bootloader.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>System rebooted into new update</strong>: The system is running from
    slot A for the first time, slot B is still bootable and successful while slot
    A is only bootable, and still active but not successful. A user space daemon
    should mark slot A as successful after some checks are made.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="update-engine-features">Update Engine features</h3>

<p>
  The <code>update_engine</code> daemon runs in the background and prepares the
  system to boot into a new, updated version. The <code>update_engine</code>
  daemon is not involved in the boot process itself and is limited in what it can
  do during an update. The <code>update_engine</code> daemon can do the
  following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Read from the current slot A/B partitions and write any data to the unused
    slot A/B partitions as instructed by the OTA package
  </li>
  <li>
    Call the <code>boot_control</code> interface in a pre-defined workflow
  </li>
  <li>
    Run a <em>post-install</em> program from the <em>new</em> partition after
    writing all the unused slot partitions, as instructed by the OTA package
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The post-install step is described in detail below. Note that the
  <code>update_engine</code> daemon is limited by the
  <a href="/security/selinux/">SELinux</a> policies and features in the
  <em>current</em> slot; those policies and features can't be updated until the
  system boots into a new version. To achieve a robustness goal, the update
  process should not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modify the partition table</li>
  <li>Modify the contents of partitions in the current slot</li>
  <li>
    Modify the contents of non-A/B partitions that can't be wiped with a
    factory reset
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="life-of-an-a-b-update">Life of an A/B update</h2>

<p>
  The update process starts when an OTA package, referred to in code as a
  <em>payload</em>, is available for downloading. Policies in the device may
  defer the payload download and application based on battery level, user
  activity, whether it is connected to a charger, or other policies. But since
  the update runs in the background, the user might not know that an update is
  in progress and the process can be interrupted at any point due to policies or
  unexpected reboots.
</p>

<p>
  The steps in the update process after a payload is available are as follows:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 1:</strong> The current slot (or "source slot") is marked as
  successful (if not already marked) with <code>markBootSuccessful()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 2:</strong> The unused slot (or "target slot") is marked as
  unbootable by calling the function <code>setSlotAsUnbootable()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The current slot is always marked as successful at the beginning of the update
  to prevent the bootloader from falling back to the unused slot, which will soon
  have invalid data. If the system has reached the point where it can start
  applying an update, the current slot is marked as successful even if other
  major components are broken (such as the UI in a crash loop) since it's
  possible to push new software to fix these major problems.
</p>

<p>
  The update payload is an opaque blob with the instructions to update to the
  new version. The update payload consists of basically two parts: the metadata
  and the extra data associated with the instructions. The metadata is
  relatively small and contains a list of operations to produce and verify the
  new version on the target slot. For example, an operation could decompress a
  certain blob and write it to certain blocks in a target partition, or read from
  a source partition, apply a binary patch, and write to certain blocks in a
  target partition. The extra data associated to the operations, not included in
  the metadata, is the bulk of the update payload and would consist of the
  compressed blob or binary patch in these examples.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 3:</strong> The payload metadata is downloaded.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 4:</strong> For each operation defined in the metadata, in order,
  the associated data (if any) is downloaded to memory, the operation is applied,
  and the associated memory is discarded.
</p>

<p>
  These two steps take most of the update time, as they involve writing and
  downloading large amounts of data, and are likely to be interrupted for reasons
  of policy or reboot.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 5:</strong> The whole partitions are re-read and verified against
  the expected hash.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 6:</strong> The post-install step (if any) is run.
</p>

<p>
  In the case of an error during the execution of any step, the update fails and
  is re-attempted with possibly a different payload. If all the steps so far have
  succeeded, the update succeeds and the last step is executed.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Step 7:</strong> The <em>unused slot</em> is marked as active by
  calling <code>setActiveBootSlot()</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Marking the unused slot as active doesn't mean it will finish booting. The
  bootloader—or system itself—can switch the active slot back if it doesn't
  read a successful state.
</p>

<h3 id="post-install-step">Post-install step</h3>

<p>
  The post-install step consists of running a program from the "new update"
  version while still running in the old version. If defined in the OTA package,
  this step is mandatory and the program must return with exit code
  <code>0</code>; otherwise, the update fails.
</p>

<p>
  For every partition where a post-install step is defined,
  <code>update_engine</code> mounts the new partition into a specific location
  and executes the program specified in the OTA relative to the mounted
  partition. For example, if the post-install program is defined as
  <code>usr/bin/postinstall</code> in the system partition, this partition from
  the unused slot will be mounted in a fixed location (for example, in
  <code>/postinstall_mount</code>) and the
  <code>/postinstall_mount/usr/bin/postinstall</code> command will be executed.
  Note that for this step to work, the following are required:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The old kernel needs to be able to mount the new filesystem format. The
    filesystem type cannot change unless there's support for it in the old
    kernel (which includes details such as the compression algorithm used if
    using a compressed filesystem like SquashFS).
  </li>
  <li>
    The old kernel needs to understand the new partition's post-install program
    format. If using an ELF binary, it should be compatible with the old
    kernel (e.g. a 64-bit new program running on an old 32-bit kernel if the
    architecture switched from 32- to 64-bit builds). Also, the libraries
    will be loaded from the old system image, not the new one, unless the loader
    (<code>ld</code>) is instructed to use other paths or build a static binary.
  </li>
  <li>
    The new post-install program will be limited by the SELinux policies defined
    in the old system.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  An example case is to use a shell script as a post-install program (interpreted
  by the old system's shell binary with a <code>#!</code> marker at the top) and
  then set up library paths from the new environment for executing a more complex
  binary post-install program.
</p>

<p>
  Another example case is to run the post-install step from a dedicated smaller
  partition, so the filesystem format in the main system partition can be updated
  without incurring backward compatibility issues or stepping-stone updates,
  allowing users to update straight to the latest version from a factory image.
</p>

<p>
  Due to the SELinux policies, the post-install step is suitable for
  performing tasks required by design on a given device or other best-effort
  tasks: update the A/B-capable firmware or bootloader, prepare copies of some
  databases for the new version, etc. This step is not suitable for one-off bug
  fixes before reboot that require unforeseen permissions.
</p>

<p>
  The selected post-install program runs in the <code>postinstall</code> SELinux
  context. All the files in the new mounted partition will be tagged with
  <code>postinstall_file</code>, regardless of what their attributes are after
  rebooting into that new system. Changes to the SELinux attributes in the new
  system won't impact the post-install step. If the post-install program needs
  extra permissions, those must be added to the post-install context.
</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>
  OEMs and SoC vendors who wish to implement the feature must add the following
  support to their bootloaders:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Pass the <a href="#kernel-command-line-arguments">correct parameters</a>
    to the kernel
  </li>
  <li>
    Implement the <code>boot_control</code> HAL
    (<a class="external-link nowrap" target="_blank"
        href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/libhardware/+/master/include/hardware/boot_control.h"
    >https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/libhardware/+/master/include/hardware/boot_control.h</a>)
  </li>
  <li>Implement the state machine as shown in Figure 1:</li>
</ul>

<img src="/devices/tech/ota/images/ab-updates-state-machine.png">

<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Bootloader state machine</p>

<p>
  The boot control HAL can be tested using the
  <a class="external-link" target="_blank"
     href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/extras/+/master/bootctl/"
  ><code>bootctl</code></a> utility.
</p>

<p>Some tests have been implemented for Brillo:</p>

    >https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/q/status:merged+project:kernel/common+branch:android-3.18+topic:A_B_Changes_3.18</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kernel-command-line-arguments">Kernel command line arguments</h3>

<p>
  The kernel command line arguments <strong>must</strong> contain the following
  extra arguments:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">skip_initramfs rootwait ro init=/init root="/dev/dm-0 dm=system none ro,0 1 \
  android-verity &lt;public-key-id&gt; &lt;path-to-system-partition&gt;"</code>
</pre>

<p>
  The <code>&lt;public-key-id&gt;</code> value is the ID of the public key used
  to verify the verity table signature (see
  <a href="/security/verifiedboot/dm-verity.html">dm-verity</a>).
</p>

<h4>
  To add the .X509 certificate containing the public key to the system keyring:
</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Copy the .X509 certificate formatted in the <code>.der</code>
    format to the root of the <code>kernel</code> directory. Use the following
    <code>openssl</code> command to convert from <code>.pem</code> to
    <code>.der</code> format (if the .X509 certificate is formatted in
    <code>.pem</code> format):
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
openssl x509 -in &lt;x509-pem-certificate&gt; -outform der -out &lt;x509-der-certificate&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Once copied to the kernel build root, build the <code>zImage</code> to
    include the certificate as part of the system keyring. This can be verified
    from the following <code>procfs</code> entry (requires
    <code>KEYS_CONFIG_DEBUG_PROC_KEYS</code> to be enabled):
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
angler:/# cat /proc/keys

1c8a217e I------     1 perm 1f010000     0     0 asymmetri
Android: 7e4333f9bba00adfe0ede979e28ed1920492b40f: X509.RSA 0492b40f []
2d454e3e I------     1 perm 1f030000     0     0 keyring
.system_keyring: 1/4
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Successful inclusion of the .X509 certificate indicates the presence of the
  public key in the system keyring. The highlighted portion denotes the public
  key ID.
</p>

<p>
  As the next step, replace the space with ‘#’ and pass it as
  <code>&lt;public-key-id&gt;</code> in the kernel command line. For example, in the
  above case, the following is passed in the place of
  <code>&lt;public-key-id&gt;</code>:
  <code>Android:#7e4333f9bba00adfe0ede979e28ed1920492b40f</code>
</p>

<h3 id="recovery">Recovery</h3>

<p>
  The recovery RAM disk is now contained in the <code>boot.img</code> file. When
  going into recovery, the bootloader <strong>cannot</strong> put the
  <code>skip_initramfs</code> option on the kernel command line.
</p>

<h3 id="build-variables">Build variables</h3>

<h5>Must define for the A/B target:</h5>

<ul>
  <li><code>AB_OTA_UPDATER := true</code></li>
  <li>
    <code>AB_OTA_PARTITIONS := \</code><br/>
    <code>&nbsp; boot \</code><br/>
    <code>&nbsp; system \</code><br/>
    <code>&nbsp; vendor</code><br/>
    and other partitions updated through <code>update_engine</code> (radio,
    bootloader, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>BOARD_BUILD_SYSTEM_ROOT_IMAGE := true</code>
  </li>
  <li><code>TARGET_NO_RECOVERY := true</code></li>
  <li>
    <code>BOARD_USES_RECOVERY_AS_BOOT := true</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>PRODUCT_PACKAGES += \</code><br/>
    <code>&nbsp; update_engine \</code><br/>
    <code>&nbsp; update_verifier</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Optionally define for debug builds:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>PRODUCT_PACKAGES_DEBUG += update_engine_client</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Cannot define for the A/B target:</h5>

<ul>
  <li><code>BOARD_RECOVERYIMAGE_PARTITION_SIZE</code></li>
  <li><code>BOARD_CACHEIMAGE_PARTITION_SIZE</code></li>
  <li><code>BOARD_CACHEIMAGE_FILE_SYSTEM_TYPE</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="partitions">Partitions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    A/B devices do not need a recovery partition or cache partition because
    Android no longer uses these partitions. The data partition is now used for
    the downloaded OTA package, and the recovery image code is on the boot
    partition.
  </li>
  <li>
    All partitions that are A/B-ed should be named as follows (slots are always
    named <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, etc.): <code>boot_a</code>,
    <code>boot_b</code>, <code>system_a</code>, <code>system_b</code>,
    <code>vendor_a</code>, <code>vendor_b</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fstab">Fstab</h3>

<p>
  The <code>slotselect</code> argument <strong>must</strong> be on the line for
  the A/B-ed partitions. For example:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
&lt;path-to-block-device&gt;/vendor  /vendor  ext4  ro
wait,verify=&lt;path-to-block-device&gt;/metadata,slotselect
</pre>

<p>
  Please note that there should be no partition named <code>vendor</code> but
  instead the partition <code>vendor_a</code> or <code>vendor_b</code> will be
  selected and mounted on the <code>/vendor</code> mount point.
</p>

<h3 id="kernel-slot-arguments">Kernel slot arguments</h3>

<p>
  The current slot suffix should be passed either through a specific DT node
  (<code>/firmware/android/slot_suffix</code>) or through the
  <code>androidboot.slot_suffix</code> command line argument.
</p>

<p>
  Optionally, if the bootloader implements fastboot, the following commands and
  variables should be supported:
</p>

<h4>Commands</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>set_active &lt;slot&gt;</code> —Sets the current active slot to
    the given slot. This must also clear the unbootable flag for that slot, and
    reset the retry count to default values.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Variables</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>has-slot:&lt;partition-base-name-without-suffix&gt;</code>
      —Returns “yes” if the given partition supports slots, “no” otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>current-slot</code> —Returns the slot suffix that will be booted from
    next.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>slot-count</code> —Returns an integer representing the number of
    available slots. Currently, two slots are supported so this value is
    <code>2</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>slot-successful:&lt;slot-suffix&gt;</code> —Returns "yes" if the given
    slot has been marked as successfully booting, "no" otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>slot-unbootable:&lt;slot-suffix&gt;</code> —Returns “yes” if the given
    slot is marked as unbootable, "no" otherwise.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>slot-retry-count:<slot suffix></code> —Number of retries remaining to
    attempt to boot the given slot.
  </li>
  <li>
    These variables should all appear under the following:
    <code>fastboot getvar all</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ota-package-generation">OTA package generation</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="/devices/tech/ota/tools.html">OTA package tools</a>
  follow the same commands as the commands for non-A/B devices. The
  <code>target_files.zip</code> file must be generated by defining the build
  variables for the A/B target. The OTA package tools automatically identify and
  generate packages in the format for the A/B updater.
</p>

<p>
  For example, use the following to generate a full OTA:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
./build/tools/releasetools/ota_from_target_files \
  dist_output/tardis-target_files.zip ota_update.zip
</pre>

<p>
  Or, generate an incremental OTA:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
./build/tools/releasetools/ota_from_target_files \
  -i PREVIOUS-tardis-target_files.zip \
  dist_output/tardis-target_files.zip incremental_ota_update.zip
</pre>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<h3 id="config-partitions">Partitions</h3>

<p>
  The Update Engine can update any pair of A/B partitions defined in the same
  disk.
</p>

<p>
  A pair of partitions has a common prefix (such as <code>system</code> or
  <code>boot</code>) and per-slot suffix (such as <code>_a</code>). The list of
  partitions for which the payload generator defines an update is configured by
  the <code>AB_OTA_PARTITIONS</code> make variable. For example, if a pair of
  partitions <code>bootloader_a</code> and <code>booloader_b</code> are included
  (<code>_a</code> and <code>_b</code> are the slot suffixes), these partitions
  can be updated by specifying the following on the product or board
  configuration:
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
AB_OTA_PARTITIONS := \
  boot \
  system \
  bootloader
</pre>

<p>
  All the partitions updated by the Update Engine must not be modified by the
  rest of the system. During incremental or <em>delta</em> updates, the binary
  data from the current slot is used to generate the data in the new slot. Any
  modification may cause the new slot data to fail verification during the
  update process, and therefore fail the update.
</p>

<h3 id="post-install">Post-install</h3>

<p>
  The post-install step can be configured differently for each updated partition
  using a set of key-value pairs.
</p>

<p>
  To run a program located at <code>/system/usr/bin/postinst</code> in a
  new image, specify the path relative to the root of the filesystem in the
  system partition. For example, <code>usr/bin/postinst</code> is
  <code>system/usr/bin/postinst</code> (if not using a RAM disk). Additionally,
  specify the filesystem type to pass to the <code>mount(2)</code> system call.
  Add the following to the product or device <code>.mk</code> files (if
  applicable):
</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
AB_OTA_POSTINSTALL_CONFIG += \
  RUN_POSTINSTALL_system=true \
  POSTINSTALL_PATH_system=usr/bin/postinst \
  FILESYSTEM_TYPE_system=ext4
</pre>

<h3 id="compilation">App compilation in background</h3>

<p>Compiling apps in the background for A/B updates requires the following two
additions to the product's device configuration (in the product's device.mk):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Include the native components in the build. This ensures the compilation
  script and binaries are compiled and included in the system image.
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
  # A/B OTA dexopt package
  PRODUCT_PACKAGES += otapreopt_script
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Connect the compilation script to <code>update_engine</code> such that it
  is run as a post-install step.
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
  # A/B OTA dexopt update_engine hookup
  AB_OTA_POSTINSTALL_CONFIG += \
    RUN_POSTINSTALL_system=true \
    POSTINSTALL_PATH_system=system/bin/otapreopt_script \
    FILESYSTEM_TYPE_system=ext4 \
    POSTINSTALL_OPTIONAL_system=true
  </pre>
  </li>
</ol>
