<p>This section describes the development and testing of the Android headset
accessory interface. This documentation presents the interface guidelines for the
Android headset inline remote.</p>

<p>Accessory manufacturers should follow the guidelines in the
<a href="plug-headset-spec.html">3.5 mm headset specification</a> or
<a href="usb-headset-spec.html">USB headset specification</a>.
Device manufacturers should follow the guidelines in the
<a href="jack-headset-spec.html">3.5 mm headset jack specification</a> or
<a href="/devices/audio/usb.html">USB digital audio page</a>.</p>

<p>The goal is to maintain certain standards for consistency and design while
allowing for freedom in design expression. If you choose to implement a
dedicated Android headset accessory, please follow these guidelines to ensure
your headset is compatible with devices following the recommendations in the <a
href="/compatibility/android-cdd.pdf">Android Compatibility Definition
Document (CDD)</a>.</p>
