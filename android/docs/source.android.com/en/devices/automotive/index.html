<p>Many car subsystems interconnect with each other and the in-vehicle
infotainment (IVI) system via various bus topologies. The exact bus type and
protocols vary widely between manufacturers (and even between different vehicle
models of the same brand); examples include Controller Area Network (CAN) bus,
Local Interconnect Network (LIN) bus, Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST),
as well as automotive-grade Ethernet and TCP/IP networks such as BroadR-Reach.
</p>
<p>the Android Automotive hardware abstraction layer (HAL) provides a
consistent interface to the Android framework regardless of physical transport
layer. This vehicle HAL is the interface for developing Android Automotive
implementations.</p>
<p>System integrators can implement a vehicle HAL module by connecting
function-specific platform HAL interfaces (e.g. HVAC) with technology-specific
network interfaces (e.g. CAN bus). Typical implementations may include a
dedicated Microcontroller Unit (MCU) running a proprietary real-time operating
system (RTOS) for CAN bus access or similar, which may be connected via a serial
link to the CPU running Android Automotive. Instead of a dedicated MCU, it may
also be possible to implement the bus access as a virtualized CPU. It is up to
each partner to choose the architecture suitable for the hardware as long as the
implementation fulfills the interface requirements for the vehicle HAL.</p>

<h2 id=arch>Architecture</h2>
<p>The vehicle HAL is the interface definition between the car and the vehicle
network service:</p>

<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1</strong>. Vehicle HAL and Android
automotive architecture</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Car API</strong>. Contains the APIs such as CarHvacManager,
CarSensorManager, and CarCameraManager. For details on supported APIs,
refer to <code>/platform/packages/services/Car/car-lib</code>.</li>
<li><strong>CarService</strong>. Located at
<code>/platform/packages/services/Car/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>VehicleNetworkService</strong>. Controls vehicle HAL with built-in
security. Access restricted to system components only (non-system components
such as third party apps should use car API instead). OEMs can control access
using <code>vns_policy.xml</code> and <code>vendor_vns_policy.xml</code>.
Located at <code>/platform/packages/services/Car/vehicle_network_service/</code>;
for libraries to access the vehicle network, refer to
<code>/platform/packages/services/Car/libvehiclenetwork/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicle HAL</strong>. Interface that defines the vehicle properties
OEMs can implement. Contains property metadata (for example, whether the vehicle
property is an int and which change modes are allowed). Located at
<code>hardware/libhardware/include/hardware/vehicle.h</code>. For a basic
reference implementation, refer to
<code>hardware/libhardware/modules/vehicle/</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, see <a href="/devices/automotive/properties.html">Vehicle
Properties</a>.

<h2 id=security>Security</h2>
<p>The vehicle HAL supports three levels of security for accessing data:</p>
<ul>
<li>System only (controlled by <code>vns_policy.xml</code>)</li>
<li>Accessible to app with permission (through car service)</li>
<li>Accessible without permission (through car service)</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct access to vehicle properties is allowed only to selected system
components with vehicle network service acting as the gatekeeper. Most
applications go through additional gatekeeping by car service (for example, only
system applications can control HVAC as it requires system permission granted
only to system apps).</p>

<h2 id=validation>Validation</h2>
<p>AOSP includes the following testing resources for use in development:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hardware/libhardware/tests/vehicle/vehicle-hal-tool.c</code><br>
Command-line native tool to load vehicle HAL and do simple operations. Useful
for getting the system up and running in the early stages of development.</li>
<li><code>packages/services/Car/tests/carservice_test/</code><br>Contains car
service testing with mocked vehicle HAL properties. For each property, expected
behavior is implemented in the test. This can be a good starting point to
understand expected behavior.</li>
<li><code>hardware/libhardware/modules/vehicle/</code><br>A basic reference
implementation.</li>
</ul>
