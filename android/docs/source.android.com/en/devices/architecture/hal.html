<p>A HAL defines a standard interface for hardware vendors to implement,
which enables Android to be agnostic about lower-level driver implementations.
Using a HAL allows you to implement functionality without affecting or modifying
the higher level system. HAL implementations are packaged into modules and
loaded by the Android system at the appropriate time.</p>

<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> HAL components</p>

<p>You must implement the corresponding HAL (and driver) for the specific
hardware your product provides. HAL implementations are typically built into
shared library modules (<code>.so</code> files), but as Android does not mandate
a standard interaction between a HAL implementation and device drivers, you can
do what is best for your situation. However, to enable the Android system to
correctly interact with your hardware, you <strong>must</strong> abide by the
contract defined in each hardware-specific HAL interface.</p>

<p>To guarantee that HALs have a predictable structure, each hardware-specific
HAL interface has properties defined in
<code>hardware/libhardware/include/hardware/hardware.h</code>. This interface
allows the Android system to load correct versions of your HAL modules in a
consistent way. A HAL interface consists of two components: modules and devices.
</p>

<h2 id="hal-module">HAL modules</h2>
<p>A module represents your packaged HAL implementation, which is stored as a
shared library (<code>.so file</code>). The
<code>hardware/libhardware/include/hardware/hardware.h</code> header file
defines a struct (<code>hw_module_t</code>) that represents a module and
contains metadata such as the version, name, and author of the module. Android
uses this metadata to find and load the HAL module correctly.</p>

<p>In addition, the <code>hw_module_t</code> struct contains a pointer to
another struct, <code>hw_module_methods_t</code>, that contains a pointer to
an open function for the module. This open function is used to initiate
communication with the hardware for which the HAL is serving as an abstraction.
Each hardware-specific HAL usually extends the generic <code>hw_module_t</code>
struct with additional information for that specific piece of hardware. For
example, in the camera HAL, the <code>camera_module_t</code> struct contains a
<code>hw_module_t</code> struct along with other camera-specific function
pointers:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
typedef struct camera_module {
    hw_module_t common;
    int (*get_number_of_cameras)(void);
    int (*get_camera_info)(int camera_id, struct camera_info *info);
} camera_module_t;
</pre>

<p>When you implement a HAL and create the module struct, you must name it
<code>HAL_MODULE_INFO_SYM</code>. Example from the Nexus 9 audio HAL:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
struct audio_module HAL_MODULE_INFO_SYM = {
    .common = {
        .tag = HARDWARE_MODULE_TAG,
        .module_api_version = AUDIO_MODULE_API_VERSION_0_1,
        .hal_api_version = HARDWARE_HAL_API_VERSION,
        .id = AUDIO_HARDWARE_MODULE_ID,
        .name = "NVIDIA Tegra Audio HAL",
        .author = "The Android Open Source Project",
        .methods = &hal_module_methods,
    },
};
</pre>

<h2 id="hal-device">HAL devices</h2>
<p>A device abstracts the hardware of your product. For example, an audio
module can contain a primary audio device, a USB audio device, or a Bluetooth
A2DP audio device.</p>

<p>A device is represented by the <code>hw_device_t</code> struct. Similar to a
module, each type of device defines a detailed version of the generic
<code>hw_device_t</code> that contains function pointers for specific features
of the hardware. For example, the <code>audio_hw_device_t</code> struct type
contains function pointers to audio device operations:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
struct audio_hw_device {
    struct hw_device_t common;

    /**
     * used by audio flinger to enumerate what devices are supported by
     * each audio_hw_device implementation.
     *
     * Return value is a bitmask of 1 or more values of audio_devices_t
     */
    uint32_t (*get_supported_devices)(const struct audio_hw_device *dev);
  ...
};
typedef struct audio_hw_device audio_hw_device_t;
</pre>

<p>In addition to these standard properties, each hardware-specific HAL
interface can define more of its own features and requirements. For details,
see the <a href="/reference/hal/">HAL reference documentation</a> as well as
the individual instructions for each HAL.</p>

<h2 id="hal-building">Building HAL modules</h2>
<p>HAL implementations are built into modules (<code>.so</code>) files and are
dynamically linked by Android when appropriate. You can build your modules by
creating <code>Android.mk</code> files for each of your HAL implementations
and pointing to your source files. In general, your shared libraries must be
named in a specific format so they can be found and loaded properly. The naming
scheme varies slightly from module to module, but follows the general pattern
of: <code>&lt;module_type&gt;.&lt;device_name&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>For details on setting up the build for each HAL, see the HAL-specific
documentation through the Porting section of this website.</p>
