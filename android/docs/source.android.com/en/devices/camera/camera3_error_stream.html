<h2 id="error-mgmt">Error management</h2>
<p>Camera HAL device ops functions that have a return value will all return <code>-ENODEV
  / NULL</code> in case of a serious error. This means the device cannot continue
  operation and must be closed by the framework. Once this error is returned by
  some method, or if <code>notify()</code> is called with <code>ERROR_DEVICE</code>, only the <code>close()</code> method
  can be called successfully. All other methods will return <code>-ENODEV / NULL</code>.</p>
<p>If a device op is called in the wrong sequence, for example if the framework
calls <code>configure_streams()</code> before <code>initialize()</code>, the device must return
<code>-ENOSYS</code> from the call, and do nothing.</p>
<p>Transient errors in image capture must be reported through <code>notify()</code> as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The failure of an entire capture to occur must be reported by the HAL by
    calling <code>notify()</codE> with <code>ERROR_REQUEST</code>. Individual errors for the result metadata
    or the output buffers must not be reported in this case.</li>
  <li>If the metadata for a capture cannot be produced, but some image buffers were
    filled, the HAL must call <code>notify()</code> with <code>ERROR_RESULT</code>.</li>
  <li>If an output image buffer could not be filled, but either the metadata was
    produced or some other buffers were filled, the HAL must call <code>notify()</code> with
    <code>ERROR_BUFFER</code> for each failed buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these transient failure cases, the HAL must still call
<code>process_capture_result</code>, with valid output <code>buffer_handle_t</code>. If the result
metadata could not be produced, it should be <code>NULL</code>. If some buffers could not be
  filled, their sync fences must be set to the error state.</p>
<p>Invalid input arguments result in <code>-EINVAL</code> from the appropriate methods. In that
  case, the framework must act as if that call had never been made.</p>
<h2 id="stream-mgmt">Stream management</h2>
<h3 id="configure_streams">configure_streams</h3>
<p>Reset the HAL camera device processing pipeline and set up new input and output
  streams. This call replaces any existing stream configuration with the streams
  defined in the <code>stream_list</code>. This method will be called at least once after
  <code>initialize()</code> before a request is submitted with <code>process_capture_request()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>stream_list</code> must contain at least one output-capable stream, and may not
  contain more than one input-capable stream.
  The <code>stream_list</code> may contain streams that are also in the currently-active set of
  streams (from the previous call to <code>configure_stream()</code>). These streams will
  already have valid values for usage, maxbuffers, and the private pointer. If
  such a stream has already had its buffers registered, <code>register_stream_buffers()</code>
  will not be called again for the stream, and buffers from the stream can be
  immediately included in input requests.</p>
<p>If the HAL needs to change the stream configuration for an existing stream due
  to the new configuration, it may rewrite the values of usage and/or maxbuffers
  during the configure call. The framework will detect such a change, and will
  then reallocate the stream buffers, and call <code>register_stream_buffers()</code> again
  before using buffers from that stream in a request.</p>
<p>If a currently-active stream is not included in <code>stream_list</code>, the HAL may safely
  remove any references to that stream. It will not be reused in a later
  <code>configure()</code> call by the framework, and all the gralloc buffers for it will be
  freed after the <code>configure_streams()</code> call returns.</p>
<p>The <code>stream_list</code> structure is owned by the framework, and may not be accessed
once this call completes. The address of an individual <code>camera3streamt</code>
  structure will remain valid for access by the HAL until the end of the first
  <code>configure_stream()</code> call which no longer includes that <code>camera3streamt</code> in the
  <code>stream_list</code> argument. The HAL may not change values in the stream structure
  outside of the private pointer, except for the usage and maxbuffers members
  during the <code>configure_streams()</code> call itself.</p>
<p>If the stream is new, the usage, maxbuffer, and private pointer fields of the
  stream structure will all be set to 0. The HAL device must set these fields
  before the <code>configure_streams()</code> call returns. These fields are then used by the
  framework and the platform gralloc module to allocate the gralloc buffers for
  each stream.</p>
<p>Before such a new stream can have its buffers included in a capture request, the
framework will call <code>register_stream_buffers()</code> with that stream. However, the
  framework is not required to register buffers for _all streams before
  submitting a request. This allows for quick startup of (for example) a preview
  stream, with allocation for other streams happening later or concurrently.</p>
<h4><strong>Preconditions</strong></h4>
<p>The framework will only call this method when no captures are being processed.
  That is, all results have been returned to the framework, and all in-flight
  input and output buffers have been returned and their release sync fences have
  been signaled by the HAL. The framework will not submit new requests for capture
  while the <code>configure_streams()</code> call is underway.</p>
<h4><strong>Postconditions</strong></h4>
<p>The HAL device must configure itself to provide maximum possible output frame
  rate given the sizes and formats of the output streams, as documented in the
  camera device's static metadata.</p>
<h4><strong>Performance expectations</strong></h4>
<p>This call is expected to be heavyweight and possibly take several hundred
  milliseconds to complete, since it may require resetting and reconfiguring the
  image sensor and the camera processing pipeline. Nevertheless, the HAL device
  should attempt to minimize the reconfiguration delay to minimize the
  user-visible pauses during application operational mode changes (such as
  switching from still capture to video recording).</p>
<h4><strong>Return values</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><code>0</code>: On successful stream configuration</li>
  <li><code>undefined</code></li>
  <li><code>-EINVAL</code>: If the requested stream configuration is invalid. Some examples of
    invalid stream configurations include:
    <ul>
      <li>Including more than 1 input-capable stream (<code>INPUT</code> or <code>BIDIRECTIONAL</code>)</li>
      <li>Not including any output-capable streams (<code>OUTPUT</code> or <code>BIDIRECTIONAL</code>)</li>
      <li>Including streams with unsupported formats, or an unsupported size for
        that format.</li>
      <li>Including too many output streams of a certain format.</li>
      <li>Note that the framework submitting an invalid stream configuration is not
        normal operation, since stream configurations are checked before
        configure. An invalid configuration means that a bug exists in the
        framework code, or there is a mismatch between the HAL's static metadata
        and the requirements on streams.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>-ENODEV</code>: If there has been a fatal error and the device is no longer
    operational. Only <code>close()</code> can be called successfully by the framework after
    this error is returned.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="register-stream">register_stream_buffers</h3>
<p>Register buffers for a given stream with the HAL device. This method is called
by the framework after a new stream is defined by <code>configure_streams</code>, and before
  buffers from that stream are included in a capture request. If the same stream
  is listed in a subsequent <code>configure_streams()</code> call, <code>register_stream_buffers</code> will
  not be called again for that stream.</p>
<p>The framework does not need to register buffers for all configured streams
  before it submits the first capture request. This allows quick startup for
  preview (or similar use cases) while other streams are still being allocated.</p>
<p>This method is intended to allow the HAL device to map or otherwise prepare the
  buffers for later use. The buffers passed in will already be locked for use. At
  the end of the call, all the buffers must be ready to be returned to the stream.
  The bufferset argument is only valid for the duration of this call.</p>
<p>If the stream format was set to <code>HAL_PIXEL_FORMAT_IMPLEMENTATION_DEFINED</code>, the
  camera HAL should inspect the passed-in buffers here to determine any
  platform-private pixel format information.</p>
<h4><strong>Return values</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li><code>0</code>: On successful registration of the new stream buffers</li>
  <li><code>-EINVAL</code>: If the streambufferset does not refer to a valid active stream, or
    if the buffers array is invalid.</li>
  <li><code>-ENOMEM</code>: If there was a failure in registering the buffers. The framework must
    consider all the stream buffers to be unregistered, and can try to register
    again later.</li>
  <li><code>-ENODEV</code>: If there is a fatal error, and the device is no longer operational.
    Only <code>close()</code> can be called successfully by the framework after this error is
    returned.</li>
</ul>
