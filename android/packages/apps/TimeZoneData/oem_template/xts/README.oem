OEM-INSTRUCTION See below for the purpose of this directory and changes to make.

This directory contains a suggested structure for CTS-like host-side tests for checking the
time zone update feature has been integrated properly.

These tests are not included in CTS because the OEM must perform their own integration and
provide their own OEM-specific signed time zone data app .apks under their own package.
